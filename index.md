<h2>CMEC</h2>
Coordinated Model Evaluation Capabilites brings together a diverse set of analysis packages that have been developed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of Earth System Models (ESMs).  Currently, CMEC includes three capabilities that are supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program (RGCM).  As CMEC advances, we expect that other analysis packages will be included from community-based expert teams as well as capabilities directly supported by DOE and other US and international agencies.      
 
A primary motivation for CMEC is to analyze model simulations that are contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).  Virtually all the institutions worldwide involved in significant development of ESMs contribute simulations to CMIP.  The 6th and latest phase (CMIP6; <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014EO090001"> Meehl et al. 2014</a>, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-1937-2016"> Eyring et al., 2016</a>) includes a partial but fundamental shift away from distinct CMIP phases with the advent of an ongoing core of benchmarking experiments known as the CMIP DECK (Diagnosis, Evaluation, Characterization of Klima – Klima being the German word for climate).   The DECK includes a short list of experimental configurations that are routinely performed by ESM developers during their model development process.   The DECK and “Historical” simulations provide a basis from which ESMs can be compared with available observations.
 
To date, many ad hoc analysis packages have been developed to target selected aspects of ESM simulations.  With the growing scope of CMIP and expectations for efficient “quick look” results, there is a clear need for the community of CMIP analysts to work together.  CMEC is establishing a framework for the developers of these capabilities to collaborate, deliver a unified set of results, and via a set of protocols make it easier for modeling groups to use some or all of the CMEC capabilities.
