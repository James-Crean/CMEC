Conventions for input data
------

The CMEC capabilities can work with a variety of data, but existing data conventions provide a design target for the software developers to maximize potential and flexibility.  <a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/Guide/modelers.html#5-model-output-requirements"> The CMIP data conventions </a> rely on the <a href="http://cfconventions.org/"> the Climate-Forecast or CF conventions </a> as a basis for defining metadata and data structures.  Efforts to provide data convetions for observational data are beginning to be used to provide the CMIP community with observations are closely linked with the CMIP6 data conventions via the <a href="https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/obs4mips"> obs4MIPs project </a>.  The emphasis of obs4MIPs to date has been on gridded data products, however efforts are underway to expand the project to include in-situ data.  While there is tremendous interest in obs4MIPs and it is having an important impact, there are many useful data products that do not yet adhere to the CMIP6/obs4MIPs data conventions.
