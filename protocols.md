Conventions for input data
------

The CMEC capabilities can work with a variety of data, but existing data conventions provide a design target for the software developers to maximize potential and flexibility.  <a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/Guide/modelers.html#5-model-output-requirements"> The CMIP data conventions </a> rely on the <a href="http://cfconventions.org/"> the Climate-Forecast or CF conventions </a> as a basis for defining metadata and data structures.  Data convetions for observational data are now being used to provide the CMIP community with observations that are closely aligned with the CMIP6 data conventions via the <a href="https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/obs4mips"> obs4MIPs project</a>.  The emphasis of obs4MIPs to date has been on gridded data products, however efforts are underway to expand the project to include in-situ and other classes of data.  Obs4MIPs is having an important impact with many data providers committing to contribute an expanding archive, however, to date there are many useful products that do not yet adhere to the CMIP6/obs4MIPs data conventions.  As a result, the handling of diverse observational datasets is a challenge for the CMEC and other model evaluation capabilities.  The CMIP6/obs4MIPs data conventions provide a foundation to build upon to ensure that systematic model evaluation can be as efficient as possible.
