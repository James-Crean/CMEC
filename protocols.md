Conventions for input data
------

The CMEC capabilities can work with a variety of data, but existing data conventions provide a design target for the software developers to maximize potential and flexibility.  <a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/Guide/modelers.html#5-model-output-requirements"> The CMIP data conventions </a> rely on the <a href="http://cfconventions.org/"> the Climate-Forecast or CF conventions </a> as a basis for defining metadata and data structures.
